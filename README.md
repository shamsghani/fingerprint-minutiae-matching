# Fingerprint Analysis Toolkit

This is a fingerprint analysis toolkit that you can step through. It's fairly comprehensive and uses things like local structures and something about cylinders that I don't remember. my success with this has been limited for fingerprints with natural variation, though in some experiments it has worked well on SOCOFING.

## Features

### Fingerprint Segmentation (Step 1)

### Estimation of Local Ridge Orientation (Step 2)

### Estimation of Local Frequency

### Fingerprint Enhancement

### Minutiae Detection

### Local Structure Analysis

### Fingerprint Comparison

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have your fingerprint images ready in BMP format.
2. Update the `directory` variable with the path to your directory of BMP files.
3. Run the script and let the magic unfold!

## Disclaimer

Like I said at the start, my success has been limited, but play around with some of the variables, and if you get good performance out of it, why not open a pull request? Remember, this is meant for educational and fun purposes only.

## Authors

This reimagined script is based on the brilliant work of Raffaele Cappelli. I have only organized it to make it more universally usable.
