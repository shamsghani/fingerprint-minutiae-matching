# Fingerprint Analysis Toolkit

Welcome to the Fingerprint Analysis Toolkit! This Python script is your all-in-one solution for analyzing fingerprints with a touch of scientific rigor.

## Features

### Fingerprint Segmentation (Step 1)

First things first, let's segment that fingerprint! We apply a touch of magic (well, mathematics and image processing) to extract the intricate details from your image.

### Estimation of Local Ridge Orientation (Step 2)

Every ridge has its orientation, just like you prefer holding your coffee mug a certain way. We estimate these orientations using some mathematical wizardry.

### Estimation of Local Frequency

Just as music has its frequencies, fingerprints have their own rhythm too! We'll figure out the local frequency of those ridges.

### Fingerprint Enhancement

Ever thought about giving your fingerprint a makeover? We'll enhance those ridges and valleys, making your fingerprint look like a superstar!

### Minutiae Detection

Let's play "Spot the Minutiae!" We'll find those key points where ridges end or bifurcate. It's like finding little fingerprint road signs.

### Local Structure Analysis

Did you know that fingerprints have their own local structures? We'll dive into the fingerprint matrix and reveal some hidden patterns using mind-bending calculations.

### Fingerprint Comparison

"Separated at Ridge?" We'll compare two fingerprints and give you a score that tells you how similar they are. It's like a DNA test for fingerprints!

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have your fingerprint images ready in BMP format.
2. Update the `directory` variable with the path to your directory of BMP files.
3. Run the script and let the magic unfold!

## Disclaimer

This toolkit is all about fingerprints, but don't try using it to analyze your love life ‚Äì that's a bit too complex even for us! Remember, this is meant for educational and fun purposes only.

## Authors

This reimagined script is based on the brilliant work of Raffaele Cappelli. We've sprinkled some digital fairy dust to organize and enhance the code while keeping the scientific essence intact.
